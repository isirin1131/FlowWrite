# FlowWrite

A browser-based visual workflow editor designed for writers working with AI.
Focused on the AI-Enhanced Text Work Experience

1. Edit your node workflow for AI text work
2. Smoother Writing（and prompt editing experience）

## Vision

FlowWrite is a local-first web application that lets writers create custom text processing workflows through a visual node-based interface. Think ComfyUI, but for text operations and AI-assisted writing.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Svelte as fe framwork, Svelte Flow(powered by xyflow) as node workflow ui, vite as build system
- Backend: sqlite3
- AI: API integration only (bring your own API keys)
